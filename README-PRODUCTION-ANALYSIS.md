## Role-Based Implementation Requirements

### 1. Authentication & Authorization System

#### Current State Analysis
**File**: `src/context/AppContext.tsx` (Lines 184-189)
```typescript
// Current hardcoded user - needs complete overhaul
const [currentUser] = useState({
  id: '1',
  name: 'John Doe',
  role: 'team-member' as const, // Basic role switching
  hourlyRate: 75,
  clientCompany: 'TechCorp' // Only for client users
})
```

#### Required Implementation
- **Supabase Auth Integration**: Replace hardcoded user with real authentication
- **Role-Based Route Protection**: Implement protected routes for each user type
- **Permission System**: Create granular permissions for each role
- **Session Management**: Persist user sessions and role information

### 2. Component Access Control

#### Time Tracker Component (`src/components/TimeTracker.tsx`)
**Current Issues**:
- No access restrictions
- All users can see all time entries
- No approval workflow

**Required Changes**:
- **Administrator**: View all time entries, approve/reject entries
- **Team Member**: Only own time entries, submit for approval
- **Client**: View time entries for their projects only (read-only)

#### Project Board Component (`src/components/ProjectBoard.tsx`)
**Current Issues**:
- Basic client filtering exists but incomplete
- No task assignment restrictions
- No approval workflows

**Required Changes**:
- **Administrator**: Full project management, assign tasks to anyone
- **Team Member**: View assigned tasks only, update task status
- **Client**: View project progress, approve deliverables

#### Client Management (`src/components/Clients.tsx`)
**Current Issues**:
- No access control
- All users can manage clients

**Required Changes**:
- **Administrator**: Full client management (CRUD operations)
- **Team Member**: View client contact information only
- **Client**: View own company information only

#### Financial Components (`src/components/Invoices.tsx`, `src/components/FinancialDashboard.tsx`)
**Current Issues**:
- No financial data protection
- All users can see all financial information

**Required Changes**:
- **Administrator**: Full financial management and reporting
- **Team Member**: Personal earnings only
- **Client**: Own invoices and billing information only

### 3. Navigation and UI Customization

#### Required Navigation Structure
```typescript
// Role-based navigation configuration
const navigationConfig = {
  admin: [
    { path: '/admin/dashboard', label: 'Dashboard', icon: 'Dashboard' },
    { path: '/admin/users', label: 'User Management', icon: 'Users' },
    { path: '/admin/clients', label: 'Client Management', icon: 'Building' },
    { path: '/admin/projects', label: 'Project Oversight', icon: 'FolderOpen' },
    { path: '/admin/financials', label: 'Financial Management', icon: 'DollarSign' },
    { path: '/admin/reports', label: 'Reports & Analytics', icon: 'BarChart' },
    { path: '/admin/settings', label: 'System Settings', icon: 'Settings' }
  ],
  'team-member': [
    { path: '/dashboard', label: 'Dashboard', icon: 'Home' },
    { path: '/time-tracker', label: 'Time Tracker', icon: 'Clock' },
    { path: '/my-tasks', label: 'My Tasks', icon: 'CheckSquare' },
    { path: '/my-projects', label: 'My Projects', icon: 'FolderOpen' },
    { path: '/my-reports', label: 'My Reports', icon: 'FileText' },
    { path: '/profile', label: 'Profile', icon: 'User' }
  ],
  client: [
    { path: '/client/dashboard', label: 'Dashboard', icon: 'Home' },
    { path: '/client/projects', label: 'My Projects', icon: 'FolderOpen' },
    { path: '/client/time-reports', label: 'Time Reports', icon: 'Clock' },
    { path: '/client/invoices', label: 'Invoices', icon: 'Receipt' },
    { path: '/client/communications', label: 'Communications', icon: 'MessageSquare' },
    { path: '/client/documents', label: 'Documents', icon: 'FileText' }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Data Filtering and Security

#### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies for Supabase

```sql
-- Users can only see their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON users
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Team members can only see their own time entries
CREATE POLICY "Team members own time entries" ON time_entries
  FOR ALL USING (
    auth.uid() = user_id OR 
    (SELECT role FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()) = 'admin'
  );

-- Clients can only see their own projects
CREATE POLICY "Clients own projects" ON projects
  FOR SELECT USING (
    (SELECT role FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()) = 'admin' OR
    (SELECT role FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()) = 'team-member' OR
    (client_id = (SELECT company_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()) AND 
     (SELECT role FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()) = 'client')
  );

-- Admins can see everything
CREATE POLICY "Admin full access" ON users
  FOR ALL USING ((SELECT role FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()) = 'admin');
```

### 5. Component Restructuring Requirements

#### Dashboard Components
**Current**: Single `Dashboard.tsx` component
**Required**: Role-specific dashboard components

```typescript
// New component structure needed
src/components/dashboards/
├── AdminDashboard.tsx
├── TeamMemberDashboard.tsx
└── ClientDashboard.tsx
```

#### Role-Specific Features
**User Management Component** (Admin only)
```typescript
// src/components/admin/UserManagement.tsx
- User creation and editing
- Role assignment
- Permission management
- Activity monitoring
```

**Client Portal Components** (Client only)
```typescript
// src/components/client/
