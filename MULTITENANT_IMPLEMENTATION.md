# Multi-Tenant User Management - Final Implementation

## Summary of Changes

### Problem Fixed
The original `AdminService.getAllUsers()` method was returning ALL users from the database, regardless of which company they belonged to. This was a major security vulnerability for multi-tenancy. Additionally, the `createUser()` method wasn't properly associating new users with the admin's company.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Fixed AdminService.getAllUsers()
- **Before**: Returned all users from all companies (security issue)
- **After**: Now properly scoped to only return users from the current admin's company
- **How**: 
  - First gets the current admin's company ID using the regular Supabase client
  - Then filters profiles by company_id using the admin client
  - Only returns auth users that have profiles in the admin's company

#### 2. Fixed AdminService.createUser()
- **Before**: Didn't properly associate new users with the admin's company
- **After**: Now passes the admin's company ID in the user metadata
- **How**:
  - Gets the current admin's company ID
  - Passes it as `admin_company_id` in the user metadata
  - The onboarding trigger uses this to create the profile in the correct company

#### 3. Updated Onboarding Trigger
- **Before**: Tried to use `auth.uid()` which doesn't work with service role
- **After**: Now uses `admin_company_id` from metadata for admin-created users
- **How**:
  - Checks for `admin_company_id` in metadata first
  - Falls back to other methods if not present
  - Ensures all users are properly associated with a company

### Key Security Features

1. **Company Isolation**: 
   - Each admin can only see/manage users in their own company
   - RLS policies enforce this at the database level
   - Service layer adds additional validation

2. **Admin-Only User Creation**:
   - Only admins can create new users
   - All created users are automatically assigned to the admin's company
   - No cross-company user access possible

3. **Invitation System**:
   - Users can be invited to join a specific company
   - Invitations are company-scoped
   - Invited users automatically get the right company association

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Companies table
companies (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  admin_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)
)

-- Profiles table (all users)
profiles (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  company_id UUID REFERENCES companies(id),
  full_name TEXT,
  role TEXT,
  hourly_rate NUMERIC
)

-- User invitations
user_invitations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  company_id UUID REFERENCES companies(id),
  invited_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending'
)
```

### RLS Policies
- Users can only view profiles in their own company
- Users can only update their own profile
- Company data is isolated per admin
- Invitations are scoped to company

### Testing
To verify the implementation:
1. Create multiple admin accounts (each gets their own company)
2. Each admin creates users in their company
3. Verify that Admin A cannot see users created by Admin B
4. Test the invitation flow between companies
5. Check that all database queries are properly scoped

### Files Modified
- `/src/lib/adminService.ts` - Fixed getAllUsers() and createUser()
- `/supabase/migrations/20250718_fix_admin_user_creation.sql` - Updated trigger
- All RLS policies ensure proper company isolation

This implementation ensures complete multi-tenant isolation while maintaining the admin-only user creation workflow.
